## What’s Inside

You’ll find demos covering tools that I've commonly used in Python development.
Each demo focuses on understading how to use different libraries & modules, while keeping the code clean and consistent.
While I tend to avoid comments, I'll leave some in places where I want to clarify the _why?_ behind that implementation.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the folders to explore topics of interest.
2. Open the folder’s README for setup steps and a quick explanation of what the demo illustrates.
3. Run the examples locally or adapt them for your own projects.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Dependencies listed inside each demo’s README or `requirements.txt` file (when applicable)
